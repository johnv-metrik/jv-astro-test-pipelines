## Project specific app snippets

This folder is intented for source control of app configurations, as well as utilising the project code editor for the code snippets.

### Guidelines

- Create a new folder for each app
- Remove any app folders that are not installed
- Keep this folder up to date (Best practice would be to make changes here and copy across to app settings)
